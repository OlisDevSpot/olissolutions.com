Ensure proper labeling of all panels, wiring, and components for reinstallation.  Turn off the solar system and disconnect it from the main electrical panel and inverter.  Pull necessary permits if required by the city (permit-related expenses to be billed separately).  Phase II: Removal of Solar Panels Carefully detach and remove all solar panels, inverters, and mounting hardware.  Inspect roof conditions and document any necessary repairs.  Store all solar panels and components safely on-site or transport them to a storage area if needed.  Clean up all debris from the work area.  Phase III: Reinstallation of Solar Panels Inspect the roof for structural integrity before reinstalling the solar system.  Install mounting brackets and ensure proper waterproofing and sealing.  Reinstall solar panels and inverters according to manufacturer specifications.  Reconnect electrical wiring and ensure proper grounding.  Conduct system testing to confirm proper functionality and output.  Schedule and facilitate city inspection (if required).  Reconnect the system to the grid and verify performance.
