# EDUCATION

This is where the rep “frames the world” you live in so you agree with their logic before numbers even come up.

## Buy Triggers

### Benefits

- Lower utility bills (30–50% reduction).
- Higher property value (5–15% increase).
- Comfort & health: cleaner air, stable temps, fewer drafts.
- Resale edge: buyers prefer efficient homes.

Psychological lever → Loss aversion: people act faster to avoid losing money than to gain it.

### Urgency

- Wildfire-related rate hikes = permanent.
- State building codes (T-24, IRA incentives) = tightening every year.
- Rebates and programs are “limited time”.
- “Waiting costs you thousands each year you don’t act.”

Psychological lever → FOMO (fear of missing out).

### Price conditioning

- Start by comparing the utility bill trend: “Rates rise ~14.2% per year.”
- Condition homeowner to accept thousands of dollars lost each year as “normal.”
- "compare on google" JS Injection
- Reframe cost as a monthly bill swap: “This isn’t an expense, it’s redirecting what you already pay.”
- Program qualification: frame the loan as exclusive access. “Not everyone qualifies. If you do, you get locked-in rates for 20 years.”

Psychological lever → Anchoring + exclusivity bias.

### Authority

- Cite government mandates (CA 2045 carbon neutrality).
- Reference T-24 law updates (2025: homes must meet efficiency standards → raises property values).
- Point to big names: PG&E, CPUC, DOE.

Psychological lever → Appeal to authority & inevitability.

### Trust

- Testimonials: “Your neighbors already traded.” (AI generated)
- Social proof: "People are reaching out daily asking to get traded." (Auto-text)

Psychological lever → Herd mentality + trust in numbers.

### Upselling

- Bundling pitch: “Doing only one trade is like fixing one tire and leaving the other three bald.”
- Start with windows or insulation → escalate to HVAC, roof, and solar.
- Cross-sell comfort: “Not just bills — imagine silent, draft-free rooms and clean air.”

Psychological lever → Completeness bias (people dislike “unfinished” scopes).

### Closing

- Fear close: “Rates are going up, you’re losing money daily.”
- Math close: “Your savings > payment, so it’s free.”
- Legacy close: “Do this for your kids, property value, or future.”

## Energy Efficiency

This is the story section — where they connect your home’s age + California’s direction + emotional hooks.

### Story

- “California is becoming more green, not less. Every year, lawmakers pass new regulations — and homes that don’t comply lose value.”
- “Title 24 in 2025 raises efficiency standards. The earlier you comply, the more your property’s value climbs.”
- “Wildfires are here to stay, and every year they trigger permanent utility rate hikes. Your bills are funding disasters, not just your usage.”

Psychological lever → Narrative framing (your house as the “problem child” in a bigger story).

### Benefits

- ROI → “Every $1 you put in returns $1.20–$1.50 in value.” (Investment bias).
  “Every $1 you put into trades, you get $1.20–$1.50 back when you sell.”
- EE scopes reduce reliance on grid
- "Carbon Tax" / Carbon penalties (JS Injection supporting article)
  Carbon penalties avoided → “Soon, inefficient homes will literally be taxed.” (Loss aversion).
  California has aggressive carbon-neutral targets by 2045. Expect surcharges on inefficient homes.
  If you don’t modernize now, you’ll literally be taxed for having an old, energy-wasting home.
- Protection from Inflation
  CA electricity rates rise at 14.2% / year
  Energy trades = fixed cost. Utilities = ever-rising variable cost.
  Fear angle: “Utilities never call you to lower your rates — but banks lock your loan.”
- Monthly Bill Swap
  Loan programs = $0 out-of-pocket, with monthly loan payments often less than current utility savings.
  Close angle: “Would you rather keep paying your utility, or pay the same (or less) into your own home?”
- Amortization of loan vs rent of utility
- Insulation & HVAC Efficiency
  1950s homes usually leak energy. Insulation, new windows, and HVAC can cut bills by 30–50%.
  Fear angle: “You’re paying to heat and cool the outdoors.”
- Comfort & Health
  stable temps, better air, less mold. (Emotional safety bias).
  Beyond bills, trades bring better indoor air quality, stable temperatures, fewer drafts, and less mold.
  Emotional angle: “You’re not just saving money — you’re protecting your family’s health.”
- Home Trade Bundling
  Reps often bundle windows, insulation, HVAC, roofing, solar, and water heaters.
  Fear angle: “Doing one without the other is like fixing one flat tire and leaving the other three bald.”
- No Out-of-Pocket Trade
  $0 down, PACE loans, or home equity loans reframed as “bill shifting.”
  Close angle: “Would you rather keep throwing money away to utilities — or redirect it into something you own?”
- Peace of Mind / Legacy
  “This isn’t just about bills — it’s about your kids, your retirement, your family’s security.” (Ego & legacy bias).
  Framed emotionally: trades protect your kids, resale, and retirement from runaway costs.
  Ego angle: “It’s not just about bills, it’s about protecting your family’s financial future.”
