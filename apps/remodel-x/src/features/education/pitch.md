1. Introduction & Rapport
   **GOAL:** Build trust, set the frame that this meeting is about their future, not your sale.
   **TAKEAWAY:** Establish credibility with light authority references: “We work with programs backed by the state of California and the federal government.”
   **Transition:** “I’m here to help you see what’s possible with your home, because California is changing fast, and older homes are being left behind.”

2. Setting the stage
   Benefits
   **Bill Reduction:** “Most families in homes like yours see 30–50% lower utility costs after trades.”
   **Comfort:** “Cleaner air, stable temps, fewer drafts.”
   **Property Value:** “Your home’s value rises 5–15% with modern efficiency.”
   **Resale:** “Buyers prefer efficient homes. Inefficient homes are becoming hard to sell.”
   **Urgency:** “Wildfire-related rate hikes are permanent — not going away.”, “New building codes like Title 24 are tightening every year.”, “Rebates and programs are temporary, and once funds are gone, they’re gone.”
   **Price Conditioning:** “Rates rise ~14.2% per year. That means your $200 bill becomes $400 in 5 years.”, “Compare it on Google if you want — you’ll see the trend everywhere.”, “This isn’t an extra expense, it’s a bill swap — you redirect money from the utility into your home.”, “Not everyone qualifies. If you do, you get locked-in rates for 20 years.”
   **Authority:** Cite mandates: “California law requires carbon neutrality by 2045. Title 24 in 2025 sets efficiency standards.”, “This isn’t just me talking — it’s the law of the land.”
   **Trust:** Testimonials: “Your neighbors have already traded.” (AI-generated or curated case studies)., Social proof: “We’re getting calls every day — people are rushing to get in before rates spike again.”
   **Upselling Seeds:** “Doing just windows or insulation is like fixing one tire and leaving the other three bald.”, “We start with the biggest leaks — then prepare you for HVAC, roof, solar.”, “It’s about creating a complete system — not a patch.”
